## How to Use Aurora? üöÄ

Getting started with optimizing your PC with Aurora is easy:

1. Open the application as an administrator for the best performance.
2. Skip the welcome message if you've already made a restoration point.
3. Choose from a variety of optimization commands or create your own. Press enter on a command and wait for it to be executed. If the program stops responding, it is normal, this is not a bug and the script will run normally due to using an external execution method
4. Edit, move, remove commands according to your preference.

# It is highly recommended to create a restoration point before making changes so you can undo them if necessary.

# We are not responsible for anything that happens to your PC; use at your own risk!
